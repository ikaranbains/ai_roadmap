AI Roadmap Designer is a full-stack web application that helps users generate detailed, visually engaging learning roadmaps for various career paths using generative AI. The application leverages Google Gemini (Generative AI) to create structured, markdown-formatted roadmaps tailored to user input, making it easy for beginners to follow and plan their learning journey.

## Key Features

- User Authentication: Users can register and log in securely. Authentication is handled with JWT tokens and passwords are hashed for security.
- AI-Powered Roadmap Generation: Users input a desired career or skill (e.g., "software developer"), and the backend uses Google Gemini to generate a multi-phase, emoji-rich, GitHub-style markdown roadmap.
- Modern UI/UX: The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive, clean, and user-friendly interface.
- Downloadable Roadmaps: Users can view, regenerate, and download their generated roadmaps as PDFs.
- Protected Routes: Certain pages (like the roadmap generator) are protected and only accessible to authenticated users.

## How It Works

1. User Registration & Login: Users create an account or log in. JWT tokens are issued and stored for session management.
2. Roadmap Generation: Authenticated users enter a career/skill. The backend sends this prompt to Google Gemini, which returns a detailed, multi-phase learning roadmap in markdown format.
3. Display & Download: The roadmap is rendered beautifully on the frontend with markdown support. Users can regenerate or download the roadmap as a PDF.
